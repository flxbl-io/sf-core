        ## Instructions!

        This automation can only be used for deleting components from the org that are currently
        not part of an existing unlocked package. It uses a just in time version of org dependent
        unlocked package to delete the component, hence only components that can be packaged can be
        used by this automation. You can check the metadata types covered by unlocked package 
        [here](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/metadata-coverage)

        ## Examples
        You need to provide the type of metadata and name of metadata in coma seperated string.
        ``` ApexClass:ContactApprovalTest ```
        If you have multiple items  you need to provide as below
        ``` ApexClass:ContactApprovalTest,ApexClass:LeadTest  ```
